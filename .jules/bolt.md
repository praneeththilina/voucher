## 2025-05-18 - Consolidating Multiple SQLite Stats Queries
**Learning:** Separate `SELECT COUNT(*)` and `SELECT SUM(...)` queries for dashboard statistics on the same table add noticeable SQLite connection query execution overhead. Consolidating multiple filtered counts into a single pass using `CASE WHEN` conditional aggregation reduces query execution overhead by ~33-35%.
**Action:** Always replace multiple `SELECT` count/sum queries targeting the same table and filter conditions with a single conditional aggregation query (`SUM(CASE WHEN ... THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)`).
